        "Title": "Original 'Flappy Bird' Creator Disavows New Version - and Its Possible Crypto Ties",
        "Details": "Flappy Bird's original creator hasn't posted anything on social media since 2017. Until today. \"This morning, the game's creator Dong Nguyen posted a characteristically terse comment stating that he has nothing to do with the revival,\" report TechCrunch, \"and that he 'did not sell anything.' He added, 'I also don't support crypto'... The post makes it clear that Nguyen is not involved with the new project, and that he doesn't seem particularly happy about it.\" As for Nguyen's reference to crypto, while the foundation's current PR materials don't mention anything crypto-related, Varun Biniwale did some digging around hidden pages on the Flappy Bird Foundation website and found a reference to Flappy Bird flying \"higher than ever on Solana as it soars into Web 3.0,\" though it's not clear whether that refers to upcoming features or abandoned plans. More from Fortune: \"Exactly what is going to happen with this zombified version of Flappy Bird is unclear, but digging through data and files has revealed things like different birds, loot boxes, and the idea that this is some sort of crypto play by the company involved. From a page on their website about the new Flappy Bird... \"[D]evelopers and creators can build, play and earn from the legendary Flappy Bird IP.\" Fortune concludes \"it's crypto, it's NFTs and everyone is so annoyed by this almost every tweet of the resurrected Twitter account has even been 'Community Noted' revealing its crypto ties and snapping up of Nguyen's trademark.\" PC Gamer adds that the Foundation acquired the Flappy Bird trademark from Gametech Holdings LLC. \"[And here there's a slight whiff of skullduggery].\" Dong Nguyen originally applied for the trademark in 2014, alongside a little drawing of the logo. This application then seemed to sit in limbo for many years, eventually being opposed by a Delaware-based company called Gametech. As this was going on, the U.S. patent office granted a trademark registration for Flappy Bird in 2018 (for years after the game was removed from sale) to another Delaware company called Mobile Media Matters. While I can't be exact on the link between Mobile Media Matters and Gametech, both companies' legal filings give the same Delaware address. Subsequent to this there's been a legal disagreement between Gametech and Dong Nguyen, except Nguyen doesn't seem to have bothered representing himself or standing up for the trademark, which has ultimately led to it being classed as abandoned (a decade after he filed for it) and acquired by Gametech... The Flappy Bird Foundation does have one ready-made comeback. As well as the rights to Flappy Bird it has acquired the rights to Piou Piou vs. Cactus, a mobile title that was the primary inspiration behind Flappy Bird, and employs the game's creator who goes by the handle, ahem, of Kek. \"Today is a milestone not just in gaming but for me personally,\" says Kek. \"It's so cool to see how influential Piou Piou has been for developers and hundreds of millions of gamers over the years. It's incredible to work alongside such a dedicated team of fans and creators who are truly passionate about changing the industry narrative and together bringing the original Flappy Bird back to life....\" Way back in 2014, Kek said he'd contacted Nguyen about the resemblance, \"and he told me he doesn't think he knew about my game when he made Flappy Bird. The games are very similar. And even if I did not invent the gameplay concept, the graphics are very close, and, of course, the concept.\" The games are undeniably similar, but there are differences, and obviously the most important one is that, for whatever reason, Piou Piou didn't do much while Flappy Bird went stratospheric with a similar idea three years later. Needless to say, the announcement and press release of the Flappy Bird Foundation does not mention Dong Nguyen once.",

        "Details": "For 30 days, 17,000 AT&T workers in nine different states from the CWA union went on strike. As it began one North Carolina newspaper noted some AT&T customers \"report prolonged internet outages.\" Last week an Emory University economist told NPR that \"If it wasn't disruptive or it didn't have any kind of negative element towards customers, then AT&T, I suspect, wouldn't feel any kind of pressure to negotiate.\" The 30-day strike was \"the longest telecommunications strike in the region's history,\" according to the union \u2014 announcing today that they'd now negotiated \"strong tentative contract agreements\" and that workers would report to work for their scheduled shifts tomorrow. The new contract in the Southeast covers 17,000 workers technicians, customer service representatives and others who install, maintain and support AT&T's residential and business wireline telecommunications network in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Wages and health care costs were key issues at the bargaining table, and the five-year agreement includes across the board wage increases of 19.33%, with additional 3% increases for Wire Technicians and Utility Operations. The health care agreement holds health care premiums steady in the first year and lowers them in the second and third years, with modest monthly increases in the final two years. The statement adds that \"CWA members and retirees from every region and sector of our union mobilized in support of our bargaining teams, including by distributing flyers with information about the strike at AT&T Wireless stores.\" CWA District 3 Vice President Richard Honeycutt added \"We know that our customers have faced hardship during the strike as well. We are happy to be getting back to work keeping our communities safe and connected.\" There's also a separate four-year agreement covering 8,500 AT&T West workers in California and Nevada. \"Union members will meet to review the tentative agreements, before holding ratification votes in each region.\" AT&T's chief operating officer said the Southeast agreement will \"support our competitive position in the broadband industry where we can grow and win against our mostly non-union competitors.\"",

        "Title": "Paraguay Loves Its Cartoon Mouse Mickey. Disney Does Not",
        "Details": "The New York Times looks at \"a third-generation family firm\" in Paraguay \"with 280 workers that packages hot sauce, soy beans...and seven kinds of salt for sale in Paraguayan supermarkets.\" Its mascot \u2014 on t-shirts, coffee cups, and \"in heavy demand at Paraguayan weddings\" \u2014 is a mouse named Mickey. 51-year-old Viviana Blasco \u2014 one of five siblings who run the business \u2014 told the Times that it all began back in 1935: Ms. Blasco's grandfather, Pascual, the son of Italian immigrants, saw an opportunity to spread some joy \u2014 and turn a profit. He opened a tiny shop selling fruit and homemade gelato. It was called Mickey... Pascual, she said, often vacationed in Buenos Aires \u2014 Argentina's cosmopolitan capital... \"On one of his trips, he must have seen the famous mouse,\" Ms. Blasco said... A few years later, Pascual opened the Mickey Ice Cream Parlor, Caf\u00e9 and Confectioners. By 1969, Mickey was selling rice, sugar and baking soda in packages now decorated with the eponymous mouse. \"Mickey resonates with Paraguayans' sense of nostalgia, said Euge Aquino, a TV chef and social media influencer who uses its ingredients to make comfort food like pastel mandi'o (yuca and beef empanadas)... Mickey's popularity, she said, also has a lot to do with the mascot handing out candy outside the factory gates every Christmas: a tradition dating back to 1983.\" By now, a \"peaceful coexistence\" reigns between Mickey and its United States doppelg\u00e4nger, said Elba Rosa Britez, 72, the smaller company's lawyer. This truce was hard-won. In 1991, Disney filed a trademark violation claim with Paraguay's Ministry of Business and Industry that was rejected. The company then filed a lawsuit, but in 1995 a trademark tribunal ruled in Mickey's favor. There, one judge agreed that Paraguayans could easily confuse the Disney Mickey and the Paraguayan Mickey. But Disney didn't reckon on a \"legal loophole,\" Ms Britez explained. The Mickey trademark had been registered in Paraguay since at least 1956 \u2014 and Pascual's descendants had since renewed it \u2014 without protest from the multinational. In 1998, Paraguay's Supreme Court issued its final ruling. Through decades of uninterrupted use, Mickey had acquired the right to be Mickey. \"I jumped for joy,\" Ms Britez said.

        "Title": "Stephen Hawking Was Wrong - Extremal Black Holes Are Possible",
        "Details": "\"[Even black holes have edge cases],\" writes Astronomy magazine contributing editor Steve Nadis, in an article in Quanta magazine (republished today by Wired): Black holes rotate in space. As matter falls into them, they start to spin faster; if that matter has charge, they also become electrically charged. In principle, a black hole can reach a point where it has as much charge or spin as it possibly can, given its mass. Such a black hole is called \"extremal\" \u2014 the extreme of the extremes. These black holes have some bizarre properties. In particular, the so-called surface gravity at the boundary, or event horizon, of such a black hole is zero. \"It is a black hole whose surface doesn't attract things anymore,\" said Carsten Gundlach, a mathematical physicist at the University of Southampton. But if you were to nudge a particle slightly toward the black hole's center, it would be unable to escape. In 1973, the prominent physicists Stephen Hawking, James Bardeen and Brandon Carter asserted that extremal black holes can't exist in the real world \u2014 that there is simply no plausible way that they can form. Nevertheless, for the past 50 years, extremal black holes have served as useful models in theoretical physics. \"They have nice symmetries that make it easier to calculate things,\" said Gaurav Khanna of the University of Rhode Island, and this allows physicists to test theories about the mysterious relationship between quantum mechanics and gravity. Now two mathematicians have proved Hawking and his colleagues wrong. The new work \u2014 contained in a pair of recent papers by Christoph Kehle of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ryan Unger of Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley \u2014 demonstrates that there is nothing in our known laws of physics to prevent the formation of an extremal black hole. Their mathematical proof is \"beautiful, technically innovative and physically surprising,\" said Mihalis Dafermos, a mathematician at Princeton University (and Kehle's and Unger's doctoral adviser). It hints at a potentially richer and more varied universe in which \"extremal black holes could be out there astrophysically,\" he added. That doesn't mean they are. \"Just because a mathematical solution exists that has nice properties doesn't necessarily mean that nature will make use of it,\" Khanna said. \"But if we somehow find one, that would really [make] us think about what we are missing.\" Such a discovery, he noted, has the potential to raise \"some pretty radical kinds of questions.\" Before Kehle and Unger's proof, there was good reason to believe that extremal black holes couldn't exist. Hawking, Bardeen, and Carter believed there was no way an extremal black hole could form, according to the article, and \"in 1986, a physicist named Werner Israel seemed to [put the issue to rest].\" But the two mathematicians, studying the formation of electrically charged black holes, stumbled into a counterexample \u2014 and along the way \"also constructed two other solutions to Einstein's equations of general relativity that involved different ways of adding charge to a black hole. Having disproved Bardeen, Carter and Hawking's hypothesis in three different contexts, the work should leave no doubt, Unger said... \"This is a beautiful example of math giving back to physics,\" said Elena Giorgi, a mathematician at Columbia University.... In the meantime, a better understanding of extremal black holes can provide further insights into near-extremal black holes, which are thought to be plentiful in the universe. \"Einstein didn't think that black holes could be real [because] they're just too weird,\" Khanna said. \"But now we know the universe is teeming with black holes.\" For similar reasons, he added, \"we shouldn't give up on extremal black holes. I just don't want to put limits on nature's creativity.\"",

        "Details": "Last October Slashdot reported on Ren\u00e9 Rebe's discovery of a random illegal instruction speculation bug on AMD Ryzen 7000-series and Epyc Zen 4 CPUs \u2014 which Rebe discussed on his YouTube channel. But this week's YouTube episode had a different ending, reports Tom's Hardware... Two days ago, tech streamer and host of Code Therapy Ren\u00e9 Rebe was streaming one of many T2 Linux (his own custom distribution) development sessions from his office in Germany when he abruptly had to remove his microphone and walk off camera due to the arrival of police officers. The officers subsequently cuffed him and took him to the station for an hour of questioning, a span of time during which the stream continued to run until he made it back... [T]he police seemingly have no idea who did it and acted based on a tip sent with an email. Finding the perpetrators could take a while, and options will be fairly limited if they don't also live in Germany. Rebe has been contributing to Linux \"since as early as 1998,\" according to the article, \"and started his own T2 SD3 Embedded Linux distribution in 2004, as well.\" (And he's also a contributor to many other major open source projects.) The article points out that Linux and other communities \"are compelled by little-to-no profit motive, so in essence, Ren\u00e9 has been providing unpaid software development for the greater good for the past two decades.\"",

        "Title": "How Amazon's Secret Weapon in Chip Design is Amazon",
        "Details": "In 2015 Amazon purchased chip designer Annapurna Labs, remembers IEEE Spectrum, \"and proceeded to design CPUs, AI accelerators, servers, and data centers as a vertically-integrated operation.\" The article argues that while AMD, Nvidia, and other big-name processor companies may also want to control the full stack (purchasing server, software, and interconnect companies) \u2014 Amazon Web Services \"got there ahead of most of the competition.\" (IEEE Spectrum interviews Ali Saidi, technical lead for the AWS Graviton series of CPUs, and Rami Sinno, director of engineering at Annapurna Labs, on \"the advantage of vertically-integrated design \u2014 and Amazon-scale...\") Sinno: I was working at Arm, and I was looking for the next adventure, looking at where the industry is heading and what I want my legacy to be. I looked at two things: One is vertically integrated companies, because this is where most of the innovation is \u2014 the interesting stuff is happening when you control the full hardware and software stack and deliver directly to customers. And the second thing is, I realized that machine learning, AI in general, is going to be very, very big. I didn't know exactly which direction it was going to take, but I knew that there is something that is going to be generational, and I wanted to be part of that. I already had that experience prior when I was part of the group that was building the chips that go into the Blackberries; that was a fundamental shift in the industry. That feeling was incredible, to be part of something so big, so fundamental. And I thought, \"Okay, I have another chance to be part of something fundamental.\" [...] At the end of the day, our responsibility is to deliver complete servers in the data center directly for our customers. And if you think from that perspective, you'll be able to optimize and innovate across the full stack. It might not be at the transistor level or at the substrate level or at the board level. It could be something completely different. It could be purely software. And having that knowledge, having that visibility, will allow the engineers to be significantly more productive and delivery to the customer significantly faster. We're not going to bang our head against the wall to optimize the transistor where three lines of code downstream will solve these problems, right...? We've had very good luck with recent college grads. Recent college grads, especially the past couple of years, have been absolutely phenomenal. I'm very, very pleased with the way that the education system is graduating the engineers and the computer scientists that are interested in the type of jobs that we have for them. It's an interesting glimpse into the unique world of designing chips at Amazon. Graviton technical lead Saidi: I've been here about seven and a half years. When I joined AWS, I joined a secret project at the time. I was told: \"We're going to build some Arm servers. Tell no one... \"In chip design, there are many different competing optimization points. You have all of these conflicting requirements, you have cost, you have scheduling, you've got power consumption, you've got size, what DRAM technologies are available and when you're going to intersect them... It ends up being this fun, multifaceted optimization problem to figure out what's the best thing that you can build in a timeframe. And you need to get it right.\"",
